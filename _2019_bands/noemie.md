title: No&Mi
dance: Bal Folk
name: noemie
description: No&Mi plays a variety of dances to melodies of her own composition, taking dancers on a magic carpet ride over a parade of swirling waltzes, mazurkas to fall in love to, and sparkling mixers. The romantic partner dances hide surprising irregularities and languishing sighs. Pleasure from ear to toe!
