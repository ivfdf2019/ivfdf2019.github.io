title: Hoik
dance: Contra
name: hoik
description: Hoik - Edward Wallace (fiddle) and Tom Oakes (guitar) - play dance music with drive and lift. Based in Edinburgh, their tunes come from the borders of British Isles and American traditions, and the name is inspired by the Scottish border town of Hawick, as well as the energy they bring to the dance floor! Edward Wallace has played fiddle for contra dances across the USA and beyond, with the Cosmic Otters, Agnostic Fiddle Insurgency, and others. Whether it's the Glen Echo Ballroom, Nelson Town Hall, or a party in a barn, he plays great tunes to get dancers moving joyously. Edward also co-organizes the regular Edinburgh contra dance. Tom Oakes is one of the UK's leading players of traditional guitar and flute and can be heard on stages round the country as well as on film soundtracks. He tours with fiddler Ross Couper and in Scottish-power-trio OBT (Oakes, Bews, Thorpe). http://www.tomoakesmusic.co.uk/
