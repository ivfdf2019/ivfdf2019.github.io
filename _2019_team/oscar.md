description: Hi, Iâ€™m Oscar. I grew up and went to school in Edinburgh so I was exposed to ceilidh dancing pretty often. When I left school it was one of the things I missed the most, and the touristy Scottish dinners we do where I work intensified that longing. The obvious thing to do, I thought, was to get involved with the folk dancing scene at my university. One thing led to another and before I knew it I was lending a hand getting IVFDF 2019 organised!
