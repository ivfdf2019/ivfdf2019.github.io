description: Helping core-committee with the website and liasoning with bands is Greg. Greg has been playing music and dancing since 2005, first with Bal Folk and later Lindy Hop, Blues and Tango. Aside from being in demand across Europe as a teacher, he has organised week long dance retreats (2008), recurring annual weekend events (2008-2010), weekly dances (2012-2016) and volunteered in just about all roles guaranteed to not poison anyone. More recently he has been working hard to fill less glamorous roles and to promote safer spaces and inclusivity.
reference: Growing up, he always had to be 10 minutes early, so now he is consistently 5 minutes late.
