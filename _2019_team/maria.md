description: Since we want everyone to come to IVFDF 2019, we have doubled up on the number of publicity officers with Maria. She has played the recorder and the flute since she was 7 and 10, respectively, and joined New Scotland and EdinBal when she moved to Scotland. She attended IVFDF first in 2015 and was part of the EUNSCDS committee first as steward, organising transport to and from dances and other events, and then as the president (2015-2017) making sure the society flourished.
reference: Give her coffee and she will give you almost anything you ask for.
