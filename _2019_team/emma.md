title: Emma Forrest
subtitle: Secretary
description: Keeping track of venue bookings, meeting minutes and everyoneâ€™s task list is Emma. She was on the New Scotland committee from 2016-2018, and helped to organise events, call dances and run workshops. From 2012-2015 she was a member, and subsequently secretary, of the Commonwealth Vintage Dancers. She helped to teach and perform historical dances and organise public events in the US and was responsible for taking notes at weekly rehearsals, running meetings and keeping track of paperwork. She has attended multiple past IVFDFs, working as a steward for most of them, and so is aware of the amount of work that goes into making the festival happen. Lastly, she has been dancing for about 18 years in a variety of styles, including historical social dance, Scottish Country, contra, and bal folk.
reference:If anyone could contra while sewing it would be her.
